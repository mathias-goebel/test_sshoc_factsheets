### Introduction

One of the research question of WP3.3 is: How is spoken text of
characters of ruling class (royality, nobility, gentry) and lower
classes — especially of servants and jesters — related to each other?
Can this relationship be quantitatively recorded algorithmically, and is
a recurring pattern discernible? In order to facilitate researchers
answering such questions [*Language Resource
Switchboard*](https://switchboard.clarin.eu/tools) has been created
which has two key functions: [*UDPipe*](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe)
has been used with texts of French, English and Spanish Baroque drama.
[*UDPipe*](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe) is an trainable pipeline for
tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing of CoNLL-U
files.

### Two ways two start

**Mind:** For some tools it can be helpful presenting solely plain text
files instead of data already anyhow tagged.

Start by going to [*Language Resource
Switchboard*](https://switchboard.clarin.eu) and take one of [two
following options:](images/00switchboardHomepage.png)

1.  Either a researcher is [already familiar with
    tools](images/01toolInventory.png) offered and know what is best to
    use answering research question or
2.  he or she wishes [a pre-selection of
    tools](images/02uploadFilesOrText.png) best fitting.

If *1.* researcher can select tools by him- or herself clicking on [Tool
inventory](https://switchboard.clarin.eu/tools) choosing wished and
afterwards finds a three ways function:

1.  [uploading a file,](images/01toolInventory.png)
2.  submitting an ULR or
3.  submitting text.

If *2.* he or she may simple type in
<https://switchboard.clarin.eu/input> in address bar of a browser and is
facing three ways function, mentioned above:

1.  uploading a file,
2.  submitting an ULR or
3.  submitting text.

### Which file formats and languages

By dragging a simple plain text file into field *Upload File* one can
learn [which *Mediatype* (file formats) and
*Language(s)*](images/04whichFileFormatsAndLanguagesAreSupported.png)
are excluded from processing in general. Eg. both *x-mobipocket-ebook*
and *xhtml+xml* are not supported whilst PDF is supported.

**Mind:** That a file format is not excluded completely does not mean
that it can be processed with all possible tools thus it is highly
recommended converting files into plain text, beforehand, if possible
and no critical information will be lost.

### Usage

In order to use [*UDPipe*](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe) [Upload files
or text](https://switchboard.clarin.eu/input) has been clicked on and
plain text file of Spanish drama *A Dios por razón de estado* by Pedro
Calderón de la Barca has been dragged onto field *Upload File*.
Selection of [four matching tools](images/05fourMatchingTools.png) will
be shown, videlicet for dependency parsing *UDPipe*, *Voyant Tools* for
distant reading, for NER *NLP-HUB* and *WebLicht Advanced Mode* for text
analytics. Different to this following [16
tools](images/06sixteenMatchingTools.png) are shown after upload of
William Shakespeare's *Cymbeline* as plain text file:

-   For constituency parsing *WebLicht Const Parsing*,
-   for dependency parsing three,
    1.  *Spacy* (hosted by D4Science) - EN
    2.  *UDPipe*
    3.  *WebLicht Dep Parsing EN*,
-   for distant reading *Voyant Tools*,
-   for lemmatization
    1.  *CSTLemma* (hosted by D4Science) and
    2.  *WebLicht Lemmas EN*,
-   for machine translation *LINDAT Translation*,
-   a morpho-syntactic tagger called *Tagger NLTK*,
-   for morphological analysis *WebLicht Morphology EN*,
-   for Named Entity Recognition three,
    1.  *NER NLTK*
    2.  *NLP-HUB (multiple NER tools)*
    3.  *WebLicht NamedEntities EN*,
-   a POS tagger named *WebLicht POSTags Lemmas EN*,
-   Text Analytics with *WebLicht Advanced Mode* and
-   for Text Enhancement *Distanbol*.

By clicking on *Open* [*UDPipe*](images/07udPipeSpanishDrama.png) this
application starts in a new tab window and spanish model for text
processing is offered and processing is starting automatically. By
clicking on *Advanced Options* further adjustments are possible and a
new processing by clicking on button [*Process
input*](images/08udPipe.png) is possible. Output both becomes visible in
separate frame in tab window and can be downloaded as file in conllu
format which is similar to a csv file.
